            <h2>Writing Buddy</h2>
            <h3>2021</h3>
            <ul class="skills">
                <li>UI/UX</li>
                <li>Branding</li>
                <li>AI</li>
                <li>Deep Learning</li>
                <li>Web Dev</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I have dyslexia and as such, have always found writing and particularly spelling difficult and tedious.
                While there are a number of tools on the market designed to aid people with learning difficulties, based
                on my experience, all fall short in one way or another. To fix this I developed Writing Buddy, a “what
                you see is what you get text editor designed to help people write better, faster and with more
                confidence.</p><button class="collapse-btn" collapsed="true"
                onclick='this.setAttribute("collapsed","true"===this.getAttribute("collapsed")?"false":"true")'>more...</button>
            <div class="collapse-body">
                <p>Writing Buddy is built on the principle that the best way to help people who struggle with writing
                    and spelling is to reduce the amount of writing and spelling they actually have to do. I achieved
                    this by developing a state of the art custom prediction engine that predicts the next word,
                    dramatically decreasing the amount of words that need to be typed. This has the additional benefit
                    of appealing to students and professionals who just want to express themselves faster than otherwise
                    possible.</p>
                <p>Nearly every part and component of Writing Buddy is bespoke, with everything from the UI/UX and
                    branding to the prediction engine designed and built by myself. The Writing Buddy editor is built in
                    TypeScript and React and the prediction engine is built with a combination of deep learning and
                    traditional computer science techniques.</p>
            </div>
            <p>You can check out the development build of Writing Buddy at <a target="_blank"
                    href="https://writingbuddy.org/"><u>WritingBuddy.org</u></a> and it is installable as a progressive
                web app (PWA).</p>

            <h2>My Own Programming Language</h2>
            <h3>2021</h3>
            <ul class="skills">
                <li>Lexing & Tokenization</li>
                <li>Syntactic Analysis</li>
                <li>Parsing</li>
                <li>Compiler & Interpreter Design</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For a while now I have been fascinated by computer languages and when over the semester break, I had a
                bit of time on my hands, I decided to—as an academic exercise—design my own language. My language
                consists of two components; the recursive descent parser which first lexers and tokenizes the input
                before generating an abstract syntax tree (AST); and the interpreter which traverses the AST and
                produces the appropriate output.</p>
            <p>My language currently includes features such as closures, lambda expressions, first class and pure
                functions, making it well-suited to functional programming. In addition to this I plan to add support
                for multithreading and a stronger type system plus optimizations for tail-call recursion. I am also
                experimenting with implementing a stack based virtual machine—bytecode interpreter—to run my language.

            </ul>
            <p>As part of the university subject IT Project, I was required to produce an ePortfolio web app as part of
                a small group. We called our app Glowbal and built it with TypeScript, React, Express and employed an
                agile development process. I was a front end lead and wrote most of the UI components. I was also
                responsible for accessibility testing and ensuring users of all abilities could access our app.</p>

            <p>For the subject Graphics and Interaction, I worked in a team to produce a time based endless runner game
                called CyberHeist. The game was built in Unity/C# and made use of a number of Azure APIs to add online
                play functionality. I was responsible for most of the online investigation and a large amount of the
                game logic, shader programming and user testing. CyberHeist received a final mark of over 95% and the
                trailer can be found below.</p>

            <p>At university, in addition to my computer science subjects, I completed a number of architecture and
                design electives. In one of my favourite architecture subjects we had to design and 3D print a pavilion
                using parametric tools and present it in VR with Unreal Engine. I programmatically modeled a magnetic
                field and extracted the field lines to inform the structure of my pavilion. I enjoyed this assignment so
                much I decided to extend myself and produce a number of 3D ray traced renders some of which are below.
                My design received first class honors and was chosen to be exhibited in the prestigious Melbourne School
                of Design annual exhibition (MSDx).</p>

            <p>The below screenshot is of a university assignment, where we had to follow a spec and use object oriented
                design principles and patterns to produce a brick-breaker type game in Java. I finished with time to
                spare so decided to implement a real time lighting and particle engine from scratch. The engine was
                capable of handling different lights at different intensities, intersecting shadows and a large number
                of shadow casting game objects.</p>

            <p>In my final year of high school I took a subject called Visual Communication Design (VCD). As part of VCD
                we were given the assignment to develop and fulfill a brief for a fictional client. I gave myself the
                brief to design a series of smart home appliances for the made up company Jackalope and produce
                accompanying visual identity and advertising material. Below is a poster of a smart speakers I designed
                with the Jackalope logo in the corner. See more of this project on <a target="_blank"

                sandbox written in Unity, where you could interact, move, rotate and scale the objects in the world to
                build anything you wanted.</p>

            <p>Great Balls of Fire was a game I made when I was 13 years old and is one of the creations I am most proud
                of. It was an endless scroller where you played as the titular Ball of Fire, attempting to stay in the
                sky by jumping on air ships. It was published on the App Store and Play Store and remained there for a
                number of years (before I got tired of paying Apple's developer fee) and even netted a few thousand
                downloads.</p>

            <p>When I was 12 years old, I played a lot of Minecraft however, I was never very happy with the low
                resolution look of the game. I decided to remedy this by creating a texture pack, which is a file
                containing alternative looks or textures for the objects in the game. When I put my work online, after
                some refinement I received my first 1000 downloads. Spotting a business opportunity, I added ads to the
                download link. My texture pack was downloaded over 50,000 times, earning me over $1000.</p>

                the domain name edsites.biz with my father’s credit card and got to work. All the HTML, CSS and even the
                JavaScript was written completely by hand by me. The website was such a success that it resulted in some
                clients albeit they were all my family members.</p>
